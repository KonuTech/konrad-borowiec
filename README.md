-   **Animations:** Includes floating and slow-spinning animations.

## Technologies Used

-   **TypeScript:** This project is primarily built using TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. This choice significantly enhances code quality, maintainability, and scalability. Key benefits of using TypeScript in this project include:
    -   **Static Typing:** Enables early error detection during development, reducing runtime bugs.
    -   **Improved Code Readability:** Explicit type annotations make the code easier to understand and maintain.
    -   **Enhanced Tooling:** TypeScript provides excellent support for code completion, refactoring, and navigation in IDEs.
    -   **Scalability:** The static typing system makes it easier to manage and grow the codebase over time, especially as the project evolves.
-   **HTML5:** Used for structuring the content and providing the semantic foundation of the website.
-   **CSS3:** Employed for styling, layout, and animations, creating a visually appealing and responsive user interface.
-   **Font Awesome:** Utilized to incorporate a wide range of icons, enhancing the visual appeal and usability of the website.
-   **Google Fonts:** Integrated to provide custom typography, using the 'Nunito' and 'Lato' font families to enhance the website's aesthetic.

## Features

-   **Responsive Design:** The site is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
-   **Social Media Sharing:** Open Graph tags are included for improved social media sharing.
-   **Animations:** Various CSS animations are used to enhance the user experience.

## Getting Started

To view the portfolio, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Customization and Development

This portfolio is designed to be highly customizable, allowing you to tailor it to your specific needs and preferences. Here's how you can modify different aspects of the project:

-   **Content Modification (HTML):** The core content of the portfolio, including text, images, and project details, can be easily modified by editing the HTML within the `index.html` file. This allows you to personalize the information presented to visitors.
-   **Styling Adjustments (CSS):** The visual appearance of the portfolio is controlled by CSS. You can modify the existing styles within the `<style>` tags in `index.html` to change colors, fonts, layout, and other design elements. This provides a quick way to adjust the look and feel of the site.
-   **TypeScript Enhancements:** As the project is primarily built with TypeScript, you can extend its functionality and add new features by writing TypeScript code. This allows for more complex interactions, dynamic content updates, and the integration of external libraries.
-   **Extending Functionality:** The use of TypeScript opens up possibilities for extending the portfolio's functionality. You can add new features, interactive elements, or integrate with external APIs using TypeScript.

## Future Improvements

-   **Content Expansion:** More content can be added to showcase additional projects and skills.
